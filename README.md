Nutrition by AI is a cutting-edge application designed to provide personalized nutritional insights using artificial intelligence. By simply uploading an image of a meal, the app calculates the calorie content and breaks down the nutritional composition, including carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and sugars. Leveraging the power of Google's Gemini Vision API, the app identifies the food items in the image, evaluates the healthiness of the meal, and offers recommendations for improving its nutritional value. Whether you're aiming for healthier eating habits or curious about your meal's nutritional details, this app provides a quick, AI-driven solution.
